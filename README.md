# Tetris-Game-SFML

I will be making a tetris game using the graphics library SFML (Simple and Fast Media Layer). This was made as a Semester Project.

### Note:
I used code from another git repository and modified it. The repository I cloned was: https://github.com/ThomasGITH/Tetris-SFML


### Modifications:
1. Added a section which shows the next piece that will come.
2. Improved rotation of blocks.
3. Added a Game Over fucntionality instead of the game just closing.
4. Changed Forwa font to Roboto.
5. Ability to change the size of the grid. The grid and the pieces will resize accordingly to fit the window size.
6. Pausing the game by pressing P.
7. A Proper Game Over.
8. The falling speed increases as you score more points.

### How to run?
#### 1. Using bash in Linux:
```
./run.sh
```

#### 2. if you don't have bash:
```
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o tetris -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system  && ./tetris
```

#### 3. if you are on windows:
The above command should also work on windows (i think).

### About SFML:
I was on Linux so downloading SFML was fairly easy. I just ran a single command that downloaded SFML from the distribution's official repository. 
If you are on windows then too bad for you since I don't know how to download and setup SFML there. Just watch some youtube video.
